# PRODIGY_DS_01
Description: For the first task, I created a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable. Using Python and libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn, I plotted the frequency distribution of a specific variable from the dataset provided by Prodigy Infotech. This visualization helped me understand the distribution of data values, identify outliers, and gain insights into the underlying patterns within the dataset.

Key Insights:

Identified the most frequent categories or ranges within the variable.
Detected any outliers or anomalies in the data distribution.
Explored potential relationships between the variable and other features in the dataset.
